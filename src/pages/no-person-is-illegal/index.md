People are not illegal. I designed this shirt to raise money for the [National Immigration Law Center](https://www.nilc.org/). They are doing vital work, and you should check them out. The shirt can be purchased through [Cotton Bureau](https://cottonbureau.com/products/npii#/1144516/tee-men-standard-tee-premium-heather-tri-blend-s).
